        <p class="para001">
          This is an important subject to consider, and one that is frequently overlooked.

           particularly destitution, has a detrimental impact on an individual's health. 
           Poverty is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, 
           infant mortality, mental illness, undernutrition, lead poisoning, asthma, and dental issues, among other things.</p>
